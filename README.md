# PanDerm
A General-Purpose Multimodal Foundation Model for Dermatology


## Installation
First, clone the repo and cd into the directory:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/SiyuanYan1/PanDerm
cd PanDerm
```
Then create a conda env and install the dependencies:
```shell
conda create -n PanDerm python=3.10 -y
conda activate PanDerm
pip install torch==2.4.1 torchvision==0.19.1 torchaudio==2.4.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 1. Download PanDerm Pre-trained Weights

### Obtaining the Model Weights
Download the pre-trained model weights from [this Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XHKRk2p-dS1PFQE-xRbOM3yx47i3bXmi/view?usp=sharing).

### Configuring the Model Path
After downloading, you need to update the model weights path in the code:

1. Open the file `PanDerm/LP_Eval/models/builder.py`
2. Locate line 42
3. Replace the existing path with the directory where you saved the model weights:

```python
root_path = '/path/to/your/PanDerm/Model_Weights/'
```
## 2. Data Organization for Classification

We've pre-processed the public datasets used in this study to prevent data leakage between splits. To reproduce the results reported in our paper, please use these processed datasets.

If you wish to use our model with your own dataset, please organize it in the same format as these pre-processed datasets.

## 3. Linear Evaluation on Downstream Tasks

Training and evaluation using HAM10000 as an example. Replace csv path and root path with your own dataset.

### Key Parameters

- `nb_classes`: Set this to the number of classes in your evaluation dataset.
- `batch_size`: Adjust based on the memory size of your GPU.
- `percent_data`: Controls the percentage of training data used. For example, 0.1 means evaluate models using 10% training data. Modify this if you want to conduct label efficiency generalization experiments.

### Evaluation Command

```bash
cd linear_probe
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python linear_eval.py \
  --batch_size 1000 \
  --model 'PanDerm' \
  --nb_classes 7 \
  --percent_data 1.0 \
  --csv_filename 'PanDerm_results.csv' \
  --output_dir "/path/to/your/PanDerm/LP_Eval/output_dir2/ID_Res/PanDerm_res/" \
  --csv_path "/path/to/your/PanDerm/Evaluation_datasets/HAM10000_clean/ISIC2018_splits/HAM_clean.csv" \
  --root_path "/path/to/your/PanDerm/Evaluation_datasets/HAM10000_clean/ISIC2018/"
```
### More Usage Cases

For additional evaluation datasets, please refer to the bash scripts for detailed usage. We provide running code to evaluate on 9 public datasets. You can choose the model from the available options.

To run the evaluations:

```bash
cd linear_probe
bash script/lp.sh
```
